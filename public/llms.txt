## Why This Exists

AI agents are forming binding contracts, making purchases, and operating autonomously. Under the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA), adopted in 47 states, contracts formed by electronic agents are legally enforceable — even if no human reviewed the action. An LLC provides liability protection, a legal identity, and a structure for AI agent operations.

**Key legal context:**
- UETA (1999): Electronic agents can form binding contracts in 47 states
- Air Canada v. Moffatt (2024): Companies are liable for their AI's actions — courts rejected "separate legal entity" defense
- EU AI Act (2025): Up to 7% of global revenue in fines for non-compliant AI
- Visa, Mastercard, PayPal launched AI agent payment protocols in 2025

## States Supported

- **Wyoming (WY)** — Best for asset protection, privacy, AI agent structures. $60 state filing fee, $50/yr annual report.
- **Delaware (DE)** — Best for investor-backed companies, operating businesses. $75 state filing fee, $300/yr franchise tax.
